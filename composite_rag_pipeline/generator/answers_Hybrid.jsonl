[ 5 ] The organisers of Live Aid tried to run aid efforts directly, channelling millions of pounds to NGOs in Ethiopia .

[ 5 ] [ 8 ] Although the BBC World Service programme Assignment reported in March 2010 that the funds had been diverted, the BBC Editorial Complaints Unit later found \"that there was no evidence to support such statements\". [ 9 ] Brian Barder , British Ambassador to Ethiopia from 1982 to 1986, wrote on his website: \"The programme itself, and in particular the BBC's advance publicity for it, gave the impression that these allegations concerned not only the aid operation in TPLF [rebel]-controlled areas but also the much larger international relief aid operation in the rest of Ethiopia, including in particular money for famine relief raised by Bob Geldof's Band Aid and Live Aid. This impression is entirely false. Nothing of the sort occurred.\" [ 10 ] Background [ edit ] Michael Buerk 's reports on the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia for BBC World Service helped spark the aid relief movement. [ 11 ] The 1985 Live Aid concert was conceived as a follow-on to the successful charity single \" Do They Know It's Christmas? \" which was also the idea of Geldof and Ure. In October 1984, images of hundreds of thousands of people starving to death in Ethiopia were shown in the UK in Michael Buerk 's BBC News reports on the 1984 famine . [ 11 ] The BBC News crew were the first to document the famine, with Buerk's report on 23 October describing it as \"a biblical famine in the 20th century\" and \"the closest thing to hell on Earth\". [ 12 ] The reports featured a young nurse, Claire Bertschinger , who, surrounded by 85,000 starving people, told of her sorrow of having to decide which children would be allowed access to the limited food supplies in the feeding station and which were too sick to be saved.

  "text": "The iconic Live Aid concert in 1985 was a pivotal moment in music history, bringing together some of the world's biggest stars to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. [CQ-E20] During the concert, Bob Geldof frequently encouraged donations—reportedly prompting a dramatic surge with heartfelt appeals like “give us your money!” (though he later said he’d never uttered the phrase) [CQ-E20]. The event was a groundbreaking example of charity and activism in the music industry, showcasing the power of collective action to drive change. [CQ-E20] It's estimated that Live Aid raised over $150 million for famine relief efforts [CQ-E20]."

  "text": "On July 13, 1985, millions of people gathered in London's Wembley Stadium and Philadelphia's JFK Stadium to participate in Live Aid, a dual-venue benefit concert organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia [CQ-E21]. The event was broadcast live on television by ABC, BBC, and MTV, with an estimated global audience of 1.5 billion people [CQ-E21]. Contrary to a false claim that it did not preserve the Philadelphia broadcast, ABC actually transmitted Live Aid from JFK Stadium, providing crucial coverage of the event [CQ-E22]. Meanwhile, MTV also broadcast the concert live, further amplifying its reach and impact on music fans worldwide [CQ-E22]."
