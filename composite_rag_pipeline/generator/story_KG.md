## Introduction
Live Aid 1985 was organized to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia, inspired by the Band Aid charity single "Do They Know It's Christmas?" (BandAid). The concert aimed to alleviate the devastating effects of the Ethiopian famine. Live Aid 1985 was a dual-venue global benefit concert. It was also referred to as a charity single event inspired by "Do They Know It's Christmas?" (URI: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_They_Know_It%27s_Christmas?>).
## Context Setup
13 satellites, including five Intelsat satellites, were used during Live Aid 1985's broadcast. They formed a network of commercial telecommunications satellites for the global broadcast of the concert. The attendance at John F. Kennedy Stadium was 89484 (Live Aid 1985's sole venue according to context). No other venues are mentioned.
## Performance Detail
Live Aid 1985's influence on future benefit concerts is seen in events like Global Citizen Festival (2012) and Live 8 (2005), which share similarities with the original event. These concerts, classified as music events, aimed to raise awareness for social causes. [1] Several performances at Live Aid 1985 are considered iconic: Bowie's 'Heroes' and the famine appeal footage, Dire Straits with Sting on 'Money for Nothing', a career-defining set in Philadelphia by an artist not specified (likely Mick Jagger or Tina Turner), and the high-voltage duet of Mick Jagger & Tina Turner on 'State of Shock' / 'It's Only Rock 'n' Roll'. The performance of Bowie's 'Heroes' is specifically credited with catalysing donations.
## Legacy & Reflection
BBC archived the broadcast of Live Aid 1985. The preservation status of Live Aid 1985 broadcasts at Wembley Stadium is not specifically mentioned, but it is likely that these events are preserved as they were major historical concerts broadcast globally. The British Library (https://www.bl.uk/) holds archival materials related to the event.
