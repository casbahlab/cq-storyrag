## Introduction

On a sweltering summer day, July 13, 1985, two of the world's most iconic music venues came alive with a shared purpose - to bring hope and aid to Ethiopia. [CQ-E2] Live Aid was a dual-venue global benefit concert held on this pivotal date, inspired by the Band Aid charity single “Do They Know It’s Christmas?” [CQ-E2]. In London, Wembley Stadium became a sea of voices, as over 72,000 spectators packed into its stands to witness history unfold. [CQ-E2] Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, an estimated 89,484 people crammed into John F. [CQ-E2] Kennedy Stadium, joining the dual-venue extravaganza that would soon go down in music lore [CQ-L4].

## Context Setup

On a sweltering summer day, July 13th, 1985 [CQ-L8], two iconic music festivals took place on opposite sides of the Atlantic: Live Aid in Philadelphia and Live Aid at Wembley Stadium in London. The event was held simultaneously to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia, with performances by some of the biggest names in music at the time [CQ-E5]. At John F. [CQ-E5] Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, a packed audience watched as Bruce Springsteen took the stage [CQ-E5], while across the pond, Wembley Stadium was filled to capacity, featuring legendary acts like The Who and Queen [CQ-E5].

## Audience Interaction

As we explore the natural world, we often find ourselves pondering the mysteries of our planet's ecosystems. According to the United Nations, approximately 8% of the Earth's land surface is now formally protected, covering an area roughly the size of China [1]. This conservation effort has led to a significant decrease in deforestation rates and biodiversity loss, with many species populations beginning to recover [2].

## Performance Detail

It was a hot summer day on July 13, 1985, when thousands of fans gathered at Wembley Stadium for an unforgettable performance lineup.

## Cultural Impact

The 1950s and 1960s were a pivotal time for music, laying the groundwork for the iconic acts that would dominate airwaves in the following decades.
