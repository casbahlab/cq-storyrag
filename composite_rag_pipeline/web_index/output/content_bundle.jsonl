This was arguably the biggest concert in rock history, featuring reunions of Led Zeppelin, the Who, Black Sabbath and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young in addition to performances from pretty much every big name in rock. How could they possibly stand out? Freddie Mercury insisted to the press that the show wasn’t any kind of competition, yet they slyly requested to go onstage at Wembley Stadium at 6:00 p.m., knowing viewership in England was likely to begin peaking around then.\nThey had their work cut out for them. “Money for Nothing” was the song of the summer, and Dire Straits had just played it with Sting before wrapping up with “Sultans of Swing.” Their set was preceded by U2, who absolutely destroyed the place with a two-song set that culminated with a 12-minute version of “Bad.” Queen also knew they were to be immediately followed by David Bowie, the first Who performance in three years and Elton John with special guest Wham!\nFreddie Mercury: His Life in Pictures\nGiven 20 minutes, Mercury’s band did everything possible to cram a full concert into it. They opened with an abbreviated “Bohemian Rhapsody” that went right into “Radio Ga Ga.” Their newest single, “Hammer to Fall,” came next, followed by “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” and the finale of “We Will Rock You” into “We Are the Champions.” Many bands were swallowed up by the enormous Wembley stage (on loan from Bruce Springsteen‘s Born in the USA tour), but Mercury worked it like an absolute pro.\nTheir task was made easier by the simple fact that the big reunions (Zeppelin, The Who, Sabbath, CSNY) fell completely flat. Those bands were woefully under-rehearsed and, in the case of Led Zeppelin, out of tune. Queen never sounded better and many critics said they stole the show, even though U2 put up a very good fight. Buoyed by the goodwill, Queen booked a stadium tour for 1986. It was another triumph, but sadly, it was to be their final outing with Mercury."}

I realise now looking back just how lucky I was to be there,\" said Jane Barclay-Trott, who got a chance to go when her then boyfriend got tickets for herself and her twin sister.\nShe remembers taking a picnic basket and getting into the stadium a couple of hours before it started. They were in the middle of the pitch, with the Royal box in front of them, watching as the then Prince and Princess of Wales came in.\nJane said they were not allowed to take cameras so she has \"no memory visually of it\" but she does remember the huge cheers as Status Quo were the first to take to the stage.\nHowever, she said it was Queen that \"stole the show\".\n\"I remember him [Freddie Mercury] coming out and he just played the start on the piano of Bohemian Rhapsody and that started it all off. He was just such a showman. Absolutely amazing.\"\nJane remembers tens of thousands of people all clapping in time to the music and she said the performance made her a lifelong Queen fan.\nOne of her other favourites was David Bowie, he paused his performance for a film which highlighted the reason for the event - raising funds for Ethiopian famine relief.\n\"Suddenly this video came up. It was so poignant. You couldn't hear a pin drop, everyone went silent. It made you realise why you were there,\" Jane explained.\nHer boyfriend videotaped the TV broadcast of the concert so they could watch it back, she has never met anyone else who was in the crowd.\n\"I still have to pinch myself, when I'm watching the footage, that I was there,\" she said.\nChris Fowler has kept some of the memorabilia from the concert on 13 July 1985, she said she remembers the ticket price (£5 with a £20 donation), paying by cheque, and buying her hero Bob Geldof's book.\n\"I think it was just to be part of something with Bob. We were Boomtown Rats fans. He was so passionate. What was not to love?\" she said.\n\"When we saw those news reports [of the famine in Ethiopia], it broke your heart.\"\nChris was also in the middle of the pitch and she remembers it was hot, but it still rained a couple of times, including when Elton John was on.\nShe said those right at the front got sprayed with hosepipes to cool off.\nChris describes \"a real babble of things going on\".\n\"Because of the diversity of the bands, you had so many different types of fans. Everybody was different,\" she said.\nLike Jane, she took food into the stadium and said that everybody shared.\nThe concert will be broadcast again on BBC Two and be available on iplayer, where there is also a three-part documentary series.\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Gloucestershire\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Aid#Background", "kind": "wiki_h2", "section": "Background", "title": "", "text": "The 1985 Live Aid concert was conceived as a follow-on to the successful charity single \" Do They Know It's Christmas? \" which was also the idea of Geldof and Ure. In October 1984, images of hundreds of thousands of people starving to death in Ethiopia were shown in the UK in Michael Buerk 's BBC News reports on the 1984 famine . The BBC News crew were the first to document the famine, with Buerk's report on 23 October describing it as \"a biblical famine in the 20th century\" and \"the closest thing to hell on Earth\". The reports featured a young nurse, Claire Bertschinger , who, surrounded by 85,000 starving people, told of her sorrow of having to decide which children would be allowed access to the limited food supplies in the feeding station and which were too sick to be saved. She would put a little mark on the children who got chosen, with Geldof stating of her at the time: \"In her was vested the power of life and death. She had become God-like and that is unbearable for anyone.\" Traumatised by what she experienced she did not speak about it for two decades, recalling in 2005: \"I felt like a Nazi sending people to the death camps. Why was I in this situation? Why was it possible in this time of plenty that some have food and some do not? It is not right.\"\n\n\"There are thousands of people outside. I have counted 10 rows, and each row has more than 100 people in, and I can only take 60–70 children today, but they all need to come in.\"\n\nShocked by the report, the British public inundated relief agencies, such as Save the Children , with donations, with the report also bringing the world's attention to the crisis in Ethiopia. Such was the magnitude of Buerk's report it was also broadcast in its entirety on a major US news channel – almost unheard of at the time. From his home in London Geldof also saw the report and called Ure from Ultravox (Geldof and Ure had previously worked together for charity when they appeared at the 1981 benefit show The Secret Policeman's Ball in London) and together they quickly co-wrote the song \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" in the hope of raising money for famine relief. Geldof then contacted colleagues in the music industry and persuaded them to record the single under the name Band Aid for nothing. On 25 November 1984, the song was recorded at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill , London, and was released four days later. It stayed at number one for five weeks in the UK, was Christmas number one , and became the fastest-selling single ever in Britain and raised £8 million, rather than the £70,000 Geldof and Ure had initially expected. Geldof then set his sights on staging a huge concert to raise further funds.\n\nThe idea to stage a charity concert to raise more funds for Ethiopia originally came from Boy George , the lead singer of Culture Club . George and Culture Club drummer Jon Moss had taken part in the recording of \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" and in the same month, the band were undertaking a tour of the UK, which culminated in six nights at Wembley Arena . On the final night at Wembley, 22 December 1984, an impromptu gathering of some of the other artists from Band Aid joined Culture Club on stage at the end of the concert for an encore of \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" George was so overcome by the occasion he told Geldof that they should consider organising a benefit concert. Speaking to the UK music magazine Melody Maker at the beginning of January 1985, Geldof revealed his enthusiasm for George's idea, saying: \"If George is organising it, you can tell him he can call me at any time, and I'll do it. It's a logical progression from the record, but the point is you don't just talk about it, you go ahead and do it!\"\n\nIt was clear from the interview that Geldof had already had the idea to hold a dual venue concert and how the concerts should be structured:\n\nThe show should be as big as is humanly possible. There's no point [in] just 5,000 fans turning up at Wembley ; we need to have Wembley linked with Madison Square Gardens , and the whole show to be televised worldwide. It would be great for Duran to play three or four numbers at Wembley and then flick to Madison Square, where Springsteen would be playing. While he's on, the Wembley stage could be made ready for the next British act like the Thompsons or whoever. In that way, lots of acts could be featured, and the television rights, tickets, and so on could raise a phenomenal amount of money. It's not an impossible idea, and certainly one worth exploiting.\n\nLive Aid production manager Andy Zweck said: \"Bob [Geldof] had to play some tricks to get artists involved. He had to call Elton and say Queen are in and Bowie's in, and of course they weren't. Then he'd call Bowie and say Elton and Queen are in. It was a game of bluff.\""}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Aid#Organisation", "kind": "wiki_h2", "section": "Organisation", "title": "", "text": "Among those involved in organising Live Aid were Harvey Goldsmith , who was responsible for the Wembley Stadium concert, and Michael C. Mitchell , who put together the American leg. On promoting the event, Goldsmith stated: \"I didn't really get a chance to say no. Bob [Geldof] arrived in my office and basically said: 'We're doing this.' It started from there.\"\n\nThe concert grew in scope as more acts were added on both sides of the Atlantic. Tony Verna , one of the inventors of instant replay , was able to secure John F. Kennedy Stadium through his friendship with Philadelphia mayor Wilson Goode and was able to procure, through his connections with ABC 's prime time chief, John Hamlin, a three-hour prime time slot on the ABC Network and, in addition, was able to supplement the lengthy programme through meetings that resulted in the addition of an ad-hoc network within the US, which covered 85 per cent of TVs there. Verna designed the needed satellite schematic and became the executive director as well as the co-executive producer alongside Hal Uplinger . Uplinger, the co-inventor of instant replay, came up with the idea to produce a four-hour video edit of Live Aid to distribute to those countries without the necessary satellite equipment to rebroadcast the live feed.

Live Aid was broadcast directly from Wembley Stadium in London and JFK Stadium in Philadelphia right across the world. Bob Geldof spearheaded the idea, after working with Midge Ure on the charity single ‘Do They Know it’s Christmas’. The idea to hold a worldwide concert was laughed out of numerous US TV network offices as it was seen to be an impossible production. Yet in just 12 short weeks, Bob Geldof’s idea became reality and more that 1.5 billion people tuned in to watch.\nIt was a whirlwind event and it has been celebrated and criticised throughout the years, but here are some facts about the lead up and actual production of the show you may not have heard before.\nNot everyone on the bill was confirmed\nJust four weeks before Live Aid was due to take place Bob Geldof and Harvey Goldsmith held a press conference where Geldof announced the artists who were ‘confirmed’ to play. However many of these acts were not confirmed, and in some cases had not even been asked.\nOne of them was Queen - who went on to give one of the most iconic performances of the entire event. When Queen were somewhat prematurely announced, their manager Jim Beach called Goldsmith immediately. Goldsmith recalls that at that point the manager of Queen had no idea what Live Aid even was, let alone whether Queen could play it.\n‘Band Aid ‘blacklist’'\nIn 1985 The Voice, a black British press outlet, criticised Live Aid for deliberately excluding black British artists. They used the headline ‘Band Aid ‘blacklist’ with the sub heading ‘Black acts dismayed at exclusions on mega concert’.\nAcross the pond in the USA, Michael Jackson and Lionel Ritchie had written the charity single ‘We are the World’ in association with Band Aid to raise money for the Ethiopian famine. Many of the black artists who were part of this song declined to participate in the concert. Although some American artists like Tina Turner and Patti LaBelle did perform, other artists like Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder did not.\nFrom Wembley Stadium to the Wembley arena\nThe band Dire Straits were doing a sell out tour at the time, and on July 13 1985 they were due to play Wembley arena, down the road from Wembley Stadium where Live Aid would be staged. Dire Straits place for the Live Aid running order left them with just one hour to get to their own gig.\nDire Straits manager Ed Bicknell recalled that they ‘had to go back immediately'. Two policewomen helped the band get out of the stadium, without having a clue on who they were, mistaking the name of the band for the predicament they found themselves in. It is reported that they told Wembley security ‘these blokes are in dire straits and they need to get out quick'.\nCross-continental by Concorde\nOne artist, Phil Collins, performed in both the Wembley and Philadelphia concerts by playing in London then flying to the US on Concorde. This was a supersonic passenger-carrying commercial aeroplane, capable of travelling from London to New York in three and a half hours. A journey that takes most aeroplanes seven to eight hours today.\nDuring his flight, producers thought it would be fun to speak to Collins live. Unfortunately the line was not very clear, and instead of hearing his voice, the viewers at home heard very loud, distorted aeroplane noises.\nWhen he landed, Collins was rushed off to join Led Zeppelin in Philadelphia. However, the performance did not go as well as expected and Led Zeppelin blamed Collins for having a bad show. Since then, the band have withheld permission for any of the footage of their Live aid performance to be broadcast.\nTransmission gone wrong in Moscow\nLive Aid was broadcast globally, the BBC has previously reported that 60 countries tuned in, but other sources like the Guinness Book of Records, claim that the show was broadcast to 150 countries.\nThe producers worked with TV networks right across the world in an attempt to make the concert a truly global event. On top of this, eight countries, including Japan, Yugoslavia and Russia, went live as part of the show. The idea was that they would have their own live segment to showcase a band.\nHowever when the show went live to Moscow, you could hear the band Autograph playing, but the pictures shown were from a documentary about a cherry harvest. Around two minutes into the performance, someone at the Russian end was able to switch the feed so people could see as well as hear the band.\nNo sound check\nDue to the fast-paced nature of the show, bands and acts did not have a chance to sound check before playing live. This caused some problems, including for the band U2 who threatened to pull-out last minute.\nOn top of this, the penultimate act of the London show was Paul McCartney. When he started to play no sound came out to the arena, and only partial sound could be heard by audiences watching the event at home. After a couple of minutes, sound engineers went on stage and turned the sound on.\nPublished in July 2025\nQuiz: How much do you know about these history-making concerts?\nThink you're a know it all when it comes to era-defining gigs?

In the spirit of the unabashedly uncool band itself, I’d like to add my voice to the chorus.\nFirst, a confession: I wasn’t even alive when Queen played Live Aid. I was born three years later in 1988, three years before Mercury died of bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS.\nMy first proper introduction came when I was about seven, when someone had left the TV on at home. There was a documentary about Queen, whose thumping, chanty music I had recently identified as “more entertaining than the Beatles” on car journeys. I sat down. By the time the program reached the Live Aid concert, I was hooked. By the end of that segment I was in love with Mercury, and when half an hour later I learned that he was dead, I was heartbroken.\nConfronted with everything in such quick succession, the tragedy and speed of his death a few years later seemed only to amplify the potency of Mercury’s most glorious performance. It felt as though having been allotted his finite portion of life, he had spent it in lavish, outrageous bursts, sharing delightedly with that crowd on July 13, 1985.\nSince then, I have watched the set many times, its exuberance and energy undiminished over the 23 years since that first viewing. This is a far from exhaustive account of why, for me, it remains magical.\nQueen didn’t open or close the Live Aid show. They performed just before 7pm, uncharacteristically in daylight, bookended by gigantic acts like U2, Elton John and David Bowie.\nPast their peak and reeling from the catastrophe of a misadvised run of shows in apartheid South Africa the previous year, Queen was not expected to shine. Mercury, in particular, had been the focus of disparaging coverage and rumors in the press, where speculation over his sexuality had arguably choked the band’s attempts to break into the American market.\nAmid an atmosphere charged with pessimism, Mercury danced out on stage and welcomed the crowd like his dearest friend. By the time he sat down at the piano and hit the first few notes of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” he was the absolute master of the stadium.\nOver the next 21 minutes, his audience, and the 1.9 billion people watching on TV around the world, fell in love with him. His humor, his hyper-masculine yet fantastically camp energy and that phenomenal four octave voice were irresistible.\nMercury was a brilliant sight. He had stripped his look to the bare essentials — white tight jeans, trademark moustache, a white tank top showing off his chest and arms, a studded band hugging his right bicep. The whole group, absent their flamboyant 1970s costumes and set paraphernalia, proved they didn’t need them. There was no distraction from the performance.\nBrian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon, his fellow bandmates, executed their role — that of Mercury’s foil — magnanimously. As a modest May mused years later: “The rest of us played okay, but Freddie was out there and took it to another level.”\nMercury was indeed a born ringmaster. There was no alienating affectation, no wallowing in sentiment. Where other bands might have been complacent, Queen swept through a distilled serving of their greatest and most bombastic hits to date, well-rehearsed over several days beforehand, with a swagger that never milked anything at the expense of the audience.\nThe only pause came at the end of “Radio Ga Ga,” which Mercury performed at the edge of the stage, pumping his sawn-off mic at the crowd. For just over 30 seconds, he led them in a vocal improvisation, which was later christened “the note heard around the world.” He carried the audience, his winks and nods making the triumph a shared one, blown kisses and thrusting hips an assurance that he was as turned on by everyone as everyone was by him.\nQueen consciously wrote their songs as vehicles for theatrics, and that day, it set them apart. They closed their set with “We Are The Champions,” an anthem built to amplify with the size of its audience. Mercury, having flown across the stage for the entire show, returned to the piano for the start of the song, echoing the set’s opening, but then came back to the crowd for the climax. He took nothing for granted, his remarkable vocals flawless till the end, even as he basked in his indisputable victory at the edge of the stage.\nThe brilliance of that set didn’t only reverberate around the world that summer. It has rippled through every viewing thereafter. For a man whose death is so focal in the history of HIV/AIDS, Mercury remains undefined by it. He greeted the world on his own terms and did whatever he loved, as and when he chose to. His spectacular performance at Live Aid, which not only resurrected Queen, but established them as one of the most successful acts of all time, is just one part of his generous legacy. It deserves to be enjoyed for many years yet.\nHolly Thomas is a British writer and editor based in London. She tweets at @HolstaT.

More people watched the concert than\nthe first step on the moon in 1969 ! But depending on which chanel you choose (or had access to) you saw a very different\ncontent.\nIn Europe, the feed was supplied by the BBC. Being a \"public - commercial free\" chanel, the BBC had a lot of interviews and chatters\nin between the various acts. As long as the concert was running in Wembley they hosted the various VIPs in a commentary booth.\nAfter the concert they used a lounge in a West End pub in London where a party was held for the performers.\nThe TV feed was mono, but a stereo simulcast sound was offered on BBC radio 1.\nThe BBC producers did the almost the best choice at all moments, only missing the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young reunion and some tiny bits\nfrom time to time.\nAs they also supplied a \"clean feed\" (without the chatters, only the concert pictures) to various TV Chanels in Europe\n(Germany ; Sweden ; France) we can find in these other sources some bits that are missing on the BBC : in Germany for exemple\nviewers saw nearly the start of Sade but suffered from a mystake during Elton John's performance which was interrupted\nby an insert from JFK which had Ashford and Simpson playing at the same time.\nThe french broadcast was a real pitty with only the \"best of\" acts at no time during the night without any telethon !\nIn the USA, the two main picture sources are ABC and MTV. Both had secured deals with \"sponsors\" which almost paid for the\nbroadcast time and production costs, but required a lot of viewing time.\nABC was responsible for the terrestrial U.S. telecast, but they telecast only the final three hours of the concert\nwith host Dick Clark. The final three hours are the network feed when the rest of the U.S. telecast was shown\nin syndication.\nABC aired a mono sound, but on some radios, a simulcast in stereo was available.\nOrbis Communications (which would briefly become the television outlet of Carolco Pictures-\n-today it is known as Paramount Domestic Television) distributed Live Aid for syndication on\nbehalf of ABC and Worldwide Sports and Entertainment.\nThe entire concert was, of course, simulcast in the U.S. on MTV using their own auspices. [ thanks to\nhiphats for these details ]\nMTV was a very young chanel and only a few people had the special stereo receiver. MTV aired the concert in stereo.\nSo, MTV offered quite a good coverage of the event, except that they had so many advertisement slots that many artists\nare incomplete (when not cut live (!) by an unfortunate advertisement). But they have managed to insert some nice interviews\nand many VIP donation calls which is very nice (and balanced their lack of informations on-screen or by the VJ's).\nAll in all, the MTV broadcast is at his best once London was over.\nIn this Top Three of the best broadcasting choice, ABC comes last by far. Bob Geldof explains in his book\nthat many artists wanted to be in the main syndicated time, because this was the time their band would get the\nbest audience. As Geldof was so fed up with these pressures he agreed at all requests ;-). But the result on ABC\nis a disaster.\nIt is quite wonderful up to Simple Minds when we are given to see some artists that were not present on any other feed.\nBut then the complete non sense starts as they were forced to \"keep\" some of the live acts for a delayed time and play instead\npreviously recorded acts.\nI can't tell how furious I would have been in 1985 to actually see and hear the Led Zep reunion and be screened Madonna instead !\nOn the previous night, MTV aired what seems to be an edited version of the Australian Live Aid counterpart \"Oz for Africa\".\nThen, in July 1995, the BBC aired a special 10 hours show with new interviews and short reports of Bob Geldof back in Africa.\nThese little shots are really great and would justify getting this version by themsleves. The show was also aired in the states\nby VH1.\nBut today, any person wishing to see an almost complete Live Aid show absolutely need all these various sources."}

Geldof had originally scheduled the event for 6 July but moved the date to the 13th, especially to accommodate Springsteen. Springsteen later expressed regret at turning down Geldof's invitation, stating that he \"simply did not realise how big the whole thing was going to be\" and regretted not performing an acoustic set. During the MTV broadcast, VJ Martha Quinn repeatedly and erroneously claimed that Springsteen would in fact make an appearance.\n\nMichael Jackson declined to appear, as he was working on Bad , an album which would not be released until more than two years after the Live Aid concert. His press agent, Norman Winter, released a statement at the time saying that Jackson was \"working around the clock in the studio on a project that he's made a major commitment to\" and consequently could not free up sufficient time to rehearse and perform at Live Aid. Winter added: \"Michael is just about living in the studio, rehearsing and recording. I know what could be more major than Live Aid, but Michael couldn't turn his back on his responsibility to the people he's working with. This affected employment for a lot of people.\"\n\nPrince also declined to appear in person but sent a pre-taped video of an acoustic version of \"4 the Tears in Your Eyes\", which was played during the concert in Philadelphia. The original version appears on the We Are the World album, while the video version was released in 1993 on Prince's compilation The Hits/The B-Sides .\n\nCulture Club leader Boy George decided not to take part in the concert. He feared that Culture Club would fail to measure up performing for two billion people, and he disliked what he viewed as self-important posturing on the part of other participants. In his memoir Take It Like a Man he said his band members were angry with him because he had \"ruined their chance of a part in history\".\n\nHuey Lewis and the News were scheduled to play the Philadelphia leg and were in some of the promotional material but decided on 28 June to pull out over concerns that the money raised by relief efforts thus far had not been reaching those it was intended to help. \"It was a very tough decision\", Lewis told Rolling Stone . \"We felt, having done the USA for Africa thing, that we should wait and watch that ... The prudent thing to do is to see how that money translates into food for the people before we do another one.\" Harry Belafonte , who had organised USA for Africa, responded harshly, calling Lewis's scepticism \"disruptive and divisive\". He had himself recently returned from a trip to Africa to see how the money had so far been spent and suggested that Lewis do the same. \"For him to sit back here and send out information based on hearsay is unfair to his colleagues and very unfair to the victims.\"\n\nAnnie Lennox , whose hits as the vocalist of Eurythmics included 1983's \" Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) \", was forced to pull out of performing at Live Aid due to a serious throat infection; she appeared at Live 8 held in Hyde Park , London in 2005.\n\nCliff Richard later stated he had been unable to perform as he was already committed to a gospel charity concert in Birmingham the same day.\n\nA reunited Deep Purple were also due to appear from Switzerland via satellite, but pulled out after guitarist Ritchie Blackmore refused to take part. Deep Purple (minus Blackmore, who left the band in 1993) appeared at Geldof's Live 8 sequel 20 years later, performing at the Toronto leg of the event. Bill Graham is said to have turned down Foreigner and Yes because there was no free space on the bill for them.\n\nMarillion , riding high in the UK charts that summer with their Misplaced Childhood album and \" Kayleigh \" single, missed out on an invitation to perform at Wembley because their manager had deemed it not worthwhile for singer Fish to participate in the \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" single. Fish was quoted: \"When it came to the bill for the concert, we were passed over.\"\n\nUB40 lead singer Ali Campbell admitted that his band was also ignored by Geldof while planning the list of musical acts of the British leg of the event: \"We weren't asked to do Live Aid because Uncle Bob didn't like our music much. It was a great gig, but I thought it was a bit dodgy not having any black acts on the bill when it was raising money for Africa.\"\n\nMadness were invited, but they declined as they were busy recording songs for their upcoming album Mad Not Mad , according to guitarist Chris Foreman . They were also in a period of heavy turmoil after falling out with Stiff Records and losing their keyboardist Mike Barson , and were considering splitting up at the time. As secondary vocalist Carl Smyth put it in 2002, \"They were going, ‘Come and do Live Aid, it’ll be really good for you. It’s gonna be televised everywhere.’ And we said, ‘Sorry mate, we’re splitting up because we’re not happy.’ Which was probably a mistake, in retrospect, but we certainly had our ideals in those days.\"\n\nThin Lizzy had broken up two years before Live Aid, with lead singer Phil Lynott 's last years heavily affected by heroin and alcohol addictions, dying less than six months after Live Aid from complications associated with his addictions. Despite this, keyboard player Darren Wharton , in a 2011 interview, expressed anger about the band not being asked to perform, believing that Geldof taking a risk and inviting the band to reunite might have helped Lynott overcome his addictions, and also regain his full performance readiness, within the few months between an invite and the concert date.\n\n\"I tried to pitch into Live Aid,\" recalled Roger Waters . \"They asked me to put Pink Floyd back together for it, and I said no, but I'd bring my new band to play. They didn't want that. But that's alright. I went along on my own.\" Waters appeared backstage at the Wembley Stadium leg of Live Aid (where he was interviewed), and the classic Pink Floyd lineup reunited for the follow-up to Live Aid, Live 8 , in 2005.\n\nNeil Peart , drummer of Canadian rock band Rush , said: \" Geddy was involved with the Northern Lights charity record here in Canada, although Rush wasn't invited to participate in the Live Aid event – mainly because if you look at the guest list, it was very much an 'in-crowd' situation. We were 'out' by then. We didn't refuse to take part because of any principles. Mind you, I wouldn't have been happy being part of this scenario. Those stars should have shut up and just given over their money if they were genuine. I recall that Tears for Fears , who made a musical and artistic decision to pull out of the concert, were subsequently accused by Geldof of killing children in Africa – what a shockingly irresponsible and stupid attitude to take. But I have nothing bad whatsoever to say about Bob Geldof; he sacrificed his health, his career, [and] everything for something he believed in. But others around him got involved for their own reasons. Some of those involved in Northern Lights were actually quoted as saying that their managers told them to get down to the recording sessions because it would be a good career move!\""}

The movie Bohemian Rhapsody ends with Queen's epic performance at Live Aid in 1985, but that's far from the final moment of Queen's tale.\nFollowing their show-stealing set at Live Aid, Queen continued to perform, release albums, and innovate as they always had. The concerts, appearances, and music from Queen's final years pushed boundaries and contributed to their legacy just as much as their earlier work. All told, Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon accomplished a lot together before Mercury passed in 1991.\nQueen Launched Their Magic Tour In June 1986\nIn conjunction with their album A Kind of Magic, Queen began a 26-city, two-month tour on June 7, 1986. A Kind of Magic, released on June 2 of that year, included 9 new tracks, many of which the band played while on the road. According to tour records, Queen visited cities throughout Europe, including Stockholm, Zurich, and London.\nTheir triumphant return to Wembley Stadium included recorded performances that were later released in audio and video formats.\nTheir 1986 Show In Budapest Transcended The Iron Curtain\nOn July 27, 1986, Queen played a concert at the Nepstadion in Budapest, Hungary, to 80,000 screaming fans. The Magic Tour proved to be a giant endeavor for the band, featuring 13 trucks of equipment for the elaborate light show on stage. According to Bohemian Rhapsody: The Definitive Biography of Freddie Mercury, Mercury performed a traditional Hungarian folk ballad, reading the lyrics to the song off of his hand.\nSomebody to Love: The Life, Death, and Legacy of Freddie Mercury claims Queen's concert in Budapest was the largest show ever played by a Western rock band in Communist Europe. After the show, someone asked Mercury if he'd visit Hungary again, and he responded, \"If I'm alive, I'll come back.\"\nThe concert was recorded and later released as Hungarian Rhapsody: Queen Live in Budapest ’86.\nThe Members Of Queen Released Albums Solo And Together\nA Kind Of Magic, released in 1986, was the band's 12th album, although most members of Queen had been working on solo projects as well. Freddie Mercury released his solo album, Mr. Bad Guy, in April 1985, and Brian May worked with Eddie Van Halen on Star Fleet Project in 1983. Roger Taylor also worked independently, even starting a separate band, The Cross, in 1987.\nMercury released Mr. Bad Guy while Queen was on hiatus. The album featured several songs that Mercury released as singles after Live Aid, including \"Living on My Own.\" Mr. Bad Guy was more disco-centric than Mercury's work with Queen. In a 1985 Rolling Stone interview, Mercury acknowledged the tracks were \"love songs, things to do with sadness... and pain, but at the same time they're frivolous and tongue in cheek.\" The album, which featured both Brian May and Roger Taylor, reached #6 on the UK charts.\nMay's Star Fleet Project also featured members of REO Speedwagon. Star Fleet Project was released as an EP with three songs, although May said releasing the tracks wasn't necessary. According to Ultimate Classic Rock, the guitarist said, \"I could have put these tapes in the bottom of a drawer and kept them as a private record of one of the best experiences of my life.\"\n- Photo:\n- Getty Images: Keystone / Stringer / Hulton Archive\nQueen Spent Six Months Writing The Songs For The 'Highlander' Soundtrack\nSix of the nine songs on Queen's A Kind of Magic album were part of the soundtrack for the 1986 movie Highlander. According to The Queen Chronology, the band first saw footage of Highlander in November 1985 and finished their contributions by late January of the next year. Tunes like \"Who Wants To Live Forever\" and \"Princes of the Universe\" are the most identifiable from the film, although the movie also featured previous hits by Queen, such as \"Hammer to Fall.\"\nQueen's 1986 release of A Kind of Magic did well on foreign and domestic charts. Even before the movie's debut in the UK in August 1986, A Kind of Magic reached #1 on the charts.\n- Photo:\nFreddie Mercury Incorporated Footage Of His 39th Birthday Party Into A Music Video\nFreddie Mercury threw elaborate parties for himself and his friends. The Times reports his 39th birthday party in 1985 at a nightclub in Munich, Germany, was a drag-themed affair featuring elaborate costumes, champagne, and caviar.\nMercury invited photographer Richard Young to the party, and Young captured some of the festivities on film. Young recalled when Mercury called him and told him, \"It's a drag ball, so everybody is coming in drag. That means you too, Richard.\" Young told Mercury, \"I can't take pictures in heels: they’re far too uncomfortable.\" But he did don a dress.\nFootage from the party made its way into the music video for Mercury's song \"Living on My Own.\"\nFreddie Mercury Collaborated With Opera Sensation Montserrat Caballé\nWhile on the Magic Tour, a Spanish reporter asked Freddie Mercury who his favorite singer was, and Mercury responded that it was Montserrat Caballé. A native of Spain, NPR reports Caballé loved singing from a young age and began performing with the Basel Opera in 1956. Caballé found out about Mercury's comments, and her brother/manager reached out to the singer a few days later.\nCaballé wanted to meet with Mercury. A very nervous Mercury was resistant at first, but the two singers had lunch together and hit it off. After Mercury gave Caballé a recording of him impersonating her, she agreed to perform his song \"Exercises in Free Love,\" according to Freddie Mercury: A Kind of Magic.\nCaballé later suggested they record something together. With piano player Mike Moran, Mercury and Caballé wrote and recorded \"Barcelona\" in 1987. The song was released in October of the same year and was featured during the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games."}

It's one of those little pegs that you hang all your other memories on.\"\n\nLive Aid eventually raised $127 million ($370 million in 2024 terms) in famine relief for African nations, and the publicity it generated encouraged Western nations to make available enough surplus grain to end the immediate hunger crisis in Africa. According to one aid worker, a larger impact than the money raised for the Ethiopian famine is that \"humanitarian concern is now at the centre of foreign policy\" for the west.\n\nRegarding Buerk's landmark BBC News report as a watershed moment in crisis reporting that influenced modern coverage – one that was broadcast in its entirety with Buerk's narration on a major US channel – Suzanne Franks in The Guardian states: \"the nexus of politics, media and aid are influenced by the coverage of a famine 30 years ago.\"\n\nMany artists and performers at Live Aid gained prominence and positive commercial influence. For all the cultural, charitable, and technological significance of 1985's Live Aid, its most immediate impact was on the charts. In the UK, for example, No Jacket Required by Phil Collins and Madonna's Like a Virgin leapt back into the top ten. Queen's three-year-old Greatest Hits rose fifty-five places into the top twenty, followed by Freddie Mercury's Mr. Bad Guy . Every U2 album available at the time also returned to the chart. In 1986, Geldof received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II for his efforts. Claire Bertschinger , the nurse who featured in Buerk's news reports that sparked the aid relief movement, received the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1991 for her work in nursing and was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2010 for \"services to Nursing and to International Humanitarian Aid\".\n\nQueen's performance at Live Aid was later recreated in the band's biographical film Bohemian Rhapsody in 2018. Footage from the original performance can be seen to match very accurately with the movie performance. In 2020, Queen + Adam Lambert reprised the original Queen setlist from Live Aid for the Fire Fight Australia charity concert in Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe background to the staging of the concert as a whole was dramatised in the 2010 television drama When Harvey Met Bob .\n\nIn November 2023, Geldof stated that a six-part miniseries about Live Aid was being produced by Disney as well as an IMAX -format theatrical documentary from Geldof himself.\n\nA jukebox musical based on the day, Just for One Day (named after a line in Bowie's song \" Heroes \", which he performed at the event), had its world premiere at The Old Vic in London in February 2024.\n\nIn August 2024, opening for Taylor Swift 's Eras Tour at Wembley Stadium, Hayley Williams , lead vocalist of Paramore , tributed Freddie Mercury's Live Aid performance. Wearing an outfit compared to the one Mercury wore, Williams led the audience in unison refrains, similar to Mercury's during Queen's set, while the other band members took a break.\n\nIn 2025, a four part documentary film series was released titled Live Aid: When Rock 'n' Roll Took on the World ."}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Aid#Fundraising", "kind": "wiki_h2", "section": "Fundraising", "title": "", "text": "Throughout the concerts, viewers were urged to donate money to the Live Aid cause. The BBC operated three hundred phone lines so that members of the public could make donations using their credit cards. The phone number and an address to which viewers could send cheques were repeated every twenty minutes.\n\nNearly seven hours into the concert in London, Bob Geldof enquired how much money had been raised so far; he was told about £1.2 million. He is said to have been sorely disappointed by the amount and marched to the BBC commentary position. Pumped up further by a performance by Queen, which he later called \"absolutely amazing\", Geldof gave an interview in which BBC presenter David Hepworth had attempted to provide a postal address to which potential donations could be sent; Geldof interrupted him in mid-flow and shouted \"fuck the address, let's get the numbers!\" Although the phrase \"give us your fuckin' money!\" has passed into folklore, Geldof has said that it was never uttered. Private Eye magazine made great humorous capital out of this outburst, emphasising Geldof's Irish accent, which meant the profanities were heard as \"fock\" or \"focking\". After the outburst, donations increased to £300 per second.\n\nLater in the evening, following David Bowie's set, a video shot by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was shown to the audiences in London and Philadelphia, as well as on televisions around the world (though neither US feed showed the film), showing starving and diseased Ethiopian children set to \" Drive \" by the Cars (this would also be shown at the London Live 8 concert in 2005). The rate of donations became faster in the aftermath of the video. Geldof had previously refused to allow the video to be shown due to time constraints and had only relented when Bowie offered to drop the song \" Five Years \" from his set as a trade-off.\n\nGeldof mentioned during the concert that the Republic of Ireland gave the most donations per capita, despite being in the midst of a serious economic recession. The largest donation came from Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , then the son of the ruler of Dubai, who donated £1m in a phone conversation with Geldof. The next day, news reports stated that between £40 and £50 million had been raised. It is now estimated that around £150 million in total has been raised for famine relief as a direct result of the concerts."}

Sting, U2, Dire Straits, The Who, David Bowie, Elvis Costello, Elton John, and George Michael were among the acts performing in London that day (Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, Madonna and Tom Petty were at the JFK Stadium in Philadelphia for the American counterpart). But of all the high-caliber artists on display that day, there was unanimous agreement that Queen’s Live Aid performance stole the whole show with a magnificent, 21-minute tour-de-force set.\nThe 2019 hit biopic Bohemian Rhapsody starts and ends with footage recreating Queen’s Live Aid concert – a performance that remains the high point of the band’s live history. Their participation was initially in doubt, however, and as recently as June 2019, guitarist Brian May admitted: “We definitely hesitated about doing Live Aid.”\nRehearsals and preparation\nAfter finally accepting The Boomtown Rats’ Bob Geldof and Midge Ure’s invitation to play the benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief, Queen – who comprised Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano, and guitar), Brian May (guitar and vocals), John Deacon (bass guitar), and Roger Taylor (drums and vocals) – were consummate professionals and decided to rehearse their set thoroughly to get timings and solos down to perfection for what would be a truncated performance.\nThey booked out the 400-seat Shaw Theatre, near King’s Cross train station in London, and spent a week honing their five-song setlist, getting it ready for the 72,000 fans who would be at Wembley – and the estimated 1.9 billion people watching on television from 130 countries around the world.\nThough the band did not like performing in daylight – and knew they would have no soundcheck to get the quality levels they wanted – they knew the concert gave them a chance to show the world what a great live band they were. “It was our opportunity to show that it’s the music first and foremost,” said May.\nGeldof had advised all the participants not to promote new hits but to do their old favorites. Queen took the message to heart. When it came to choosing time slots, they were shrewd, opting to go on at 6.41pm, which was close to prime time in the UK and also after the satellite feed from London of the live broadcast had gone global.\nQueen’s Live Aid performance\nQueen were immediately preceded at Wembley by the comedians Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith – who were dressed as policemen and joked about receiving a complaint about the noise “from a woman in Belgium.” They introduced “the next combo” as “Her Majesty… Queen.”\nA truly charismatic Mercury, who looked full of confidence, jogged out on to a vast stage whose top was adorned with a banner saying “Feed The World.” Mercury, sporting his trademark mustache and wearing white jeans, a white tank top, and with a studded band around his right bicep, began by sitting at the piano and playing a short, inspired version of “Bohemian Rhapsody.”\n“The note heard around the world”\nDuring “Radio Ga Ga” he got up and strutted around the stage, using the microphone and stand as a prop, and getting the fired-up crowd to join in with the chorus. The next few moments were remarkable, as Mercury led the 72,000 spectators in some spine-tingling vocal improvisation, as they sang along to “ay-oh.” His final, wonderful vocal was dubbed “the note heard around the world.”\nThe singalong fun was followed by a version of “Hammer To Fall,” a song written by May. Mercury, who had strapped on an electric guitar, then addressed the crowd. “This next song is only dedicated to beautiful people here tonight – which means all of you. Thank you for coming along, you are making this a great occasion,” he said, before launching into an energetic, exuberant performance of his own composition, “Crazy Little Thing Called Love.”\nAfter a short version of “We Will Rock You,” the swaying, delirious crowd were treated to a finale of “We Are The Champions.” Mercury was simply mesmerizing. “I’d never seen anything like that in my life and it wasn’t calculated, either… it was the greatest day of our lives,” said May.\n“You bastards, you stole the show”\nIt wasn’t only Queen who realized they had been sensational. Paul Gambaccini, who was part of the BBC broadcasting team at Live Aid, recalled the awe among other superstar musicians watching backstage. “Everybody realized that Queen was stealing the show,” said Gambaccini. These were the very words Elton John uttered when he rushed into Mercury’s trailer after the set. “You bastards, you stole the show,” joked the charismatic star.\n“Queen smoked ’em. They just took everybody. They walked away being the greatest band you’d ever seen in your life, and it was unbelievable,” said Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters. “And that’s what made the band so great; that’s why they should be recognized as one of the greatest rock bands of all time, because they could connect with an audience.”\n“It was the perfect stage for Freddie: the whole world”\nTwo months later Queen began work on the album A Kind Of Magic, which sold six million copies and was promoted with a record-breaking world tour.\nThe choice of album title was apt. Queen provided magic on that summer day in 1985. Their impact was summed up by Geldof. “Queen were absolutely the best band of the day,” the Live Aid organizer said. “They played the best, had the best sound, used their time to the full. They understood the idea exactly, that it was a global jukebox. They just went and smashed one hit after another. It was the perfect stage for Freddie: the whole world.”\nLooking for more? Check out music journalist Richard Havers’ personal memories of the Queen Live Aid performance.\n-\n1.9 million people? Proves you are utterly clueless\n-\nI’m sure the writer can edit the word million and correctly change it to billion.\n-\n-\nI was there at LiveAid and I went to see Queen. They stole the show. Freddie was magnificent, the best I have ever seen him perform. Loved every second of it.\n-\nI too was there and I still get goosebumps when I dwell back on it. Mesmerizing simply mesmerizing.\n-\n-\nTwo people: “I was there! I went to see Queen.”\nIf all the Americans were added up who said “I was at Woodstock” there would have been 85 million people at Woodstock in 1969!\nDorothy if you went there to see Queen??? Queen was despised as they had just played Sun City, a white resort city in South Africa IN THE MIDDLE OF APARTHEID! Anyone who played there was a traitor to humanity.\nLittle Stevie…Steven Van Zandt (E Street Band) produced the song “Ain’t gonna play Sun City” w g DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Melle Mel, The Fat Boys, Rubén Blades, Bob Dylan, Herbie Hancock, Ringo Starr and his son Zak Starkey, Lou Reed, Run DMC, Peter Gabriel, David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, Darlene Love, Bobby Womack, Afrika Bambaataa, Kurtis Blow, Jackson Browne and Daryl Hannah (his girlfriend at the time), U2, George Clinton, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, Peter Wolf, Bonnie Raitt, Hall & Oates, Jimmy Cliff, Big Youth, Michael Monroe, Peter Garrett, Ron Carter, Ray Barretto, Gil Scott-Heron, Kashif, Nona Hendryx, Pete Townshend, Pat Benatar, Clarence Clemons, Stiv Bators and Joey Ramone.\nLive Aid saved Queen’s butt after their phenomenal idiocy in playing that resort.\n-\nLive Aid didn’t have to save their butt, they were loved around the world no matter what they did and therefore, if they were to have had a regular stadium concert, just as many would have been there, just saying..\n-\n-\nIt was an unforgettable performance – nothing else came close\n-\nHuge Queen fan here in the USA… Saw it live on TV… In my humble opinion, the only thing that they could’ve done to make it better would have been to omit Hammer To Fall… So many other great songs they could’ve done instead… I suspect it was a nod to Brian, and his choice… I bet he’d admit he should’ve picked one of his other tunes…\n-\nRemarkable. In company with the greatest performers in the world, Queen played their hits with maximum effort and outshone every other performance. Watching it more than 30 years later only confirms the magic they produced.\n-\nLet’s be honest, Queen aren’t very good. They probably aren’t as bad as I think they are, but they are definitely worse than you (and they) think they are.\n-\nGotta Love a Good Troll LOL\n-\nI wasn’t there at the concert, but wish I was. I have seen the movie and every time I see it, it brings tears to my eyes seeing how he connected to the audience. It is as if the band and the audience were one in the same. Simply amazing and powerful. This is how music can bring everybody together. Has to be one of the best live concerts of all time, and I’m not even a big Queen fan, but I am more of a fan now because of this concert.\n-\nAPARTHEID was mentioned by Helena in 2019. 3 years later I say and people in South Africa have said that the greatest harm was done when US Pension plans, etc., pulled their investments out of South Africa. Pensions lost money big time and put the brakes on what was naturally happening in the country at the time, transition from Apartheid. The US press had a lot to do with this back sliding.\nThere will always be bias but companies there were treating employees as equals. You hear of ‘black buses’? Yes. fare was 1/12 the fare on a white bus. Anyone would ride the white bus if they had the $$. The government paid the 11/12 portion.\nThe list goes on and on.\nThere is injustice everywhere, even now. Sun city was a red herring. -\nHelena,\nSo despised that Nelson Mandela requested them personally for his 46664 concert. Go figure\n-\nMinor thing to note per the article in its current state— Freddie actually had on faded blue jeans, not white ones. It’s hard to tell in the embedded video, but if you look at other photos and videos, they’re definitely a pale blue.\n-\nTo think Freddie later said it felt like he was gargling stones during the entire performance since he had recently had throat surgery. Who knew??? Couldn’t even tell. Amazing!!!\n-\nAnybody on this forum at the Philadelphia Live Aid? I was there and I swear they played Queen’s performance on screens in Philadelphia but I can’t find any actual record/video of it. Everyone had their hands up singing We Are the Champions at the end. True or too much MJ?? LOL Thank you!\n-\nSIMPLY THE GREATEST LIVE PERORMANCE OF ALL TIME, BAR NONE!\nNUFFSAID."}

Our major coordinating control point was Philadelphia. Everything, including Wembley, came into Philadelphia before it went to be seen on the BBC. The stadium in Philadelphia was simply an ideal place control, because there was an area in back of the stadium. We had, I think, 35 trailers there and an entire field of satellite dishes that controlled our uplinks and downlinks. We were able to have a place where we could control all communications. From there it simply becomes a logistical situation to put the proper people to handle the proper jobs and to make sure that it all comes together from a master control truck. It was from this master control point that we had a world feed truck and a USA truck. We were feeding MTV as well. Then, of course, with all the rest of the vehicles, there were the video tape units or whatever else was necessary. Our problem was time. We didn’t have enough time. Yet the fact that we didn’t have the time probably made it possible.”\nUplinger won the 1989 Computerworld Smithsonian Award in the Media, Arts & Entertainment Category for his production of the “Live Aid Concert.”\nThe event itself raised more than $125 million in famine relief for Africa, as well as global awareness of a critical humanitarian issue.\nFrom Live Aid to the moon landing, Intelsat has transmitted the biggest moments in the world for everyone to share.

Explore the story of how it all began and how things unfolded.\nOnce upon a time, in the mid-1980s, the world witnessed a phenomenon that would change charity concerts forever – Live Aid. It was more than just a musical event, it was a globe-spanning, rock-and-roll revolution that united the world in a common cause.\nRead on for a stroll down memory lane and relive the magic, the madness and the monumental impact of Live Aid.\nThe spark of inspiration\nLive Aid was the brainchild of Irish Rocker, Bob Geldof. The lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, Geldof had been deeply moved by a BBC documentary highlighting the horrific famine in Ethiopia.\nDetermined to make a difference, along with Midge Ure of the band Ultravox, he quickly wrote the now-iconic charity single Do They Know It’s Christmas? The song was then performed by a supergroup of well-known British and Irish musicians under the name Band Aid. It became an instant hit and raised millions for famine relief.\nBut this was just the beginning. Geldof wanted something even bigger. He envisioned a global concert that would not only raise money but also increase awareness of the need on a massive scale.\nThe making of a mega-concert\nOrganising a global concert was no small feat. It was a logistical nightmare of epic proportions. Mainly because the idea was that two main concerts would take place on two different continents – Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. The concerts would be broadcast live via satellite and create a continuous 16-hour music marathon that the whole world could watch.\nGeldof used his fame and Irish charm to convince musicians and industry executives to get on board. The lineup quickly became a who’s who of rock and pop royalty – Queen, David Bowie, U2, The Who, Madonna and a reunited Led Zeppelin, to name just a few.\nOn 13th July 1985, the world tuned in as Prince Charles and Princess Diana officially opened the concert. Wembley Stadium kicked off at noon, London time, with a performance by Status Quo. The concert then bounced across the Atlantic to Philadelphia, where Joan Baez greeted the crowd saying, ‘This is your Woodstock, and it’s long overdue.’\nThe performances that rocked the world\nLive Aid wasn’t just about raising money – it was about making history. And it certainly did that. All the performances were electric and unforgettable. Queen, with Freddie Mercury’s commanding presence, played a 21-minute set, which is often said to be one of the greatest live performances in rock history.\nWhen U2 performed, Bono leapt off the stage to dance with a fan, delighting the thousands of spectators. And David Bowie’s rendition of Heroes highlighted the spirit of the event.\nIn Philadelphia, artists had their own legendary moments. Mick Jagger and Tina Turner performed a sizzling duet, and Bob Dylan joined together with Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, adding to the magic.\nThe all-star finale featured a rendition of We Are the World, written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. It was a stunning ending to the concert, bringing everyone together in a powerful display of unity.\nThe global impact\nLive Aid became a clear call to action. Raising over $127 million for famine relief in Africa, it also brought the issue of global poverty into the living rooms of millions. People started important conversations and were inspired to get involved in all sorts of charitable causes.\nThe aftermath and legacy\nIn the years after Live Aid, Bob Geldof continued his humanitarian efforts, even earning a knighthood. The concert’s success also encouraged celebrities to get more involved in charity work, highlighting the usefulness of fame in making a real-world difference.\nThe legacy of Live Aid is a powerful one. It showed that music can be used for immense good and set a precedent for future benefit concerts. Events such as Farm Aid, Live 8 and Global Citizen Festival. It also inspired a musical – Just For One Day – which played at London’s Old Vic Theatre from January to March 2024.\nLive Aid proved that when the world comes together, incredible things can happen. It was a music concert, but more importantly, it was a global statement of compassion, solidarity and hope. So, the next time you hear the opening chords of Bohemian Rhapsody or Born in the USA, remember that summer day in 1985 when music truly changed the world."}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Aid#Broadcasts", "kind": "wiki_h2", "section": "Broadcasts", "title": "", "text": "Broadcaster Richard Skinner opened the Live Aid concert with the words:\n\nIt's twelve noon in London, seven AM in Philadelphia, and around the world it's time for Live Aid.\n\nThe concert was the most ambitious international satellite television venture that had ever been attempted at the time. In Europe, the television feed was supplied by the BBC via the EBU ; its broadcast was presented by Richard Skinner , Andy Kershaw , Mark Ellen , David Hepworth , Andy Batten-Foster , Steve Blacknell, Paul Gambaccini , Janice Long and Mike Smith and included numerous interviews and chats among the various acts. The BBC's television sound feed was mono, as was all UK television audio before NICAM was introduced, but the BBC Radio 1 feed was stereo and was simulcast in sync with the television pictures. Unfortunately, in the rush to set up the transatlantic feeds, the sound feed from Philadelphia was sent to London via transatlantic cable, while the video feed was via satellite, which meant a lack of synchronisation on British television receivers. Due to the constant activities in both London and Philadelphia, the BBC producers broadcast only two songs from the reunion of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young after 10 pm; the same applied to Rick Springfield and REO Speedwagon. BBC broadcast only one song from the Black Sabbath set, around 3 am.  Ashford & Simpson' \"Solid\" was not broadcast on the BBC. The BBC, however, did supply a \"clean feed\" to various television channels in Europe.\n\nABC was largely responsible for the US broadcast (although ABC themselves telecast only the final three hours of the concert from Philadelphia, hosted by Dick Clark , with the rest shown in syndication through Orbis Communications , acting on behalf of ABC). An entirely separate and simultaneous US feed was provided for cable viewers by MTV ; its broadcast was presented in stereo and accessible as such for those with stereo televisions. At the time, before multichannel television sound was enacted nationwide, very few televisions reproduced stereo signals, and few television stations were able to broadcast in stereo. While the telecast was run advertisement-free by the BBC, both the MTV and syndicated/ABC broadcasts included advertisements and interviews. As a result, many songs were omitted due to the commercial breaks, as these songs were played during these slots.\n\nThe biggest issue of the syndicated/ABC coverage is that the network had wanted to reserve some of the biggest acts that had played earlier in the day for certain points in the entire broadcast, particularly in the final three hours in prime time; thus, Orbis Communications had some sequences replaced by others, especially those portions of the concert that had acts from London and Philadelphia playing simultaneously. For example, while the London/Wembley finale was taking place at 22:00 (10:00 pm) London time, syndicated viewers saw segments that had been recorded earlier so that ABC could show the UK finale during its prime-time portion. In 1995, VH1 and MuchMusic aired a re-edited ten-hour re-broadcast of the concert for its 10th anniversary.\n\nThe Live Aid concert in London was also the first time that the BBC outside broadcast sound equipment had been used for an event of such scale. In stark contrast to the mirrored sound systems commonly used by the rock band touring engineers, with two 40–48-channel mixing consoles at the front of house and another pair for monitors, the BBC sound engineers had to use multiple 12-channel desks. Some credit this as the point where the mainstream entertainment industry realised that the rock concert industry had overtaken them in technical expertise."}
