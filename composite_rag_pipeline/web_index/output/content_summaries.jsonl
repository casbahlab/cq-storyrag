The idea for a large-scale concert originated with Boy George of Culture Club, following a December 22, 1984, performance.  Geldof envisioned a dual-venue concert (Wembley and Madison Square Garden) broadcast globally, a plan requiring significant negotiation with artists, as confirmed by production manager Andy Zweck."}
