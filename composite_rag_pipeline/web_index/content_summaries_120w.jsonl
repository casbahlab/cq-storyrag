  "summary": "Flashback: Queen Steal the Show at Live Aid Queen had a pretty tough task when they took the stage at Live Aid in July of 1985. This was arguably the biggest concert in rock history, featuring reunions of Led Zeppelin, the Who, Black Sabbath and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young in addition to performances from pretty much every big name in rock. How could they possibly stand out? Freddie Mercury insisted to the press that the show wasn’t any kind of competition, yet they slyly requested to go onstage at Wembley Stadium at 6:00 p.m., knowing viewership in England was likely to begin peaking around then.",

Two women from Gloucestershire were among 72,000 fans watching at Wembley Stadium in London and recall their experiences ahead of the anniversary of the historic concert on Sunday. \"It just was the most amazing day. I realise now looking back just how lucky I was to be there,\" said Jane Barclay-Trott, who got a chance to go when her then boyfriend got tickets for herself and her twin sister. She remembers taking a picnic basket and getting into the stadium a couple of hours before it started.",

  "summary": "The 1985 Live Aid concert was conceived as a follow-on to the successful charity single \" Do They Know It's Christmas? \" which was also the idea of Geldof and Ure. In October 1984, images of hundreds of thousands of people starving to death in Ethiopia were shown in the UK in Michael Buerk 's BBC News reports on the 1984 famine . The BBC News crew were the first to document the famine, with Buerk's report on 23 October describing it as \"a biblical famine in the 20th century\" and \"the closest thing to hell on Earth\".",

  "summary": "On the July 13 1985, a cross-continental concert changed live music forever. Live Aid was broadcast directly from Wembley Stadium in London and JFK Stadium in Philadelphia right across the world. Bob Geldof spearheaded the idea, after working with Midge Ure on the charity single ‘Do They Know it’s Christmas’. The idea to hold a worldwide concert was laughed out of numerous US TV network offices as it was seen to be an impossible production. Yet in just 12 short weeks, Bob Geldof’s idea became reality and more that 1.5 billion people tuned in to watch. It was a whirlwind event and it has been celebrated and criticised throughout the years, but here are some facts about the lead up and actual production of the show you may not have heard before.",

  "summary": "By Holly Thomas It’s been more than 33 years since Queen, spearheaded by their electric front man Freddie Mercury, charged onto the stage of the 1985 Live Aid concert and performed the set often lauded as the greatest live gig of all time. The release of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the Queen biopic starring Rami Malek as Mercury, has provoked a swell of nostalgia and emotion around that moment in musical history. In the spirit of the unabashedly uncool band itself, I’d like to add my voice to the chorus. First, a confession: I wasn’t even alive when Queen played Live Aid. I was born three years later in 1988, three years before Mercury died of bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS.",

But depending on which chanel you choose (or had access to) you saw a very different content. In Europe, the feed was supplied by the BBC. Being a \"public - commercial free\" chanel, the BBC had a lot of interviews and chatters in between the various acts. As long as the concert was running in Wembley they hosted the various VIPs in a commentary booth. After the concert they used a lounge in a West End pub in London where a party was held for the performers. The TV feed was mono, but a stereo simulcast sound was offered on BBC radio 1.",

Geldof had originally scheduled the event for 6 July but moved the date to the 13th, especially to accommodate Springsteen. Springsteen later expressed regret at turning down Geldof's invitation, stating that he \"simply did not realise how big the whole thing was going to be\" and regretted not performing an acoustic set. During the MTV broadcast, VJ Martha Quinn repeatedly and erroneously claimed that Springsteen would in fact make an appearance. Michael Jackson declined to appear, as he was working on Bad , an album which would not be released until more than two years after the Live Aid concert.",

Following their show-stealing set at Live Aid, Queen continued to perform, release albums, and innovate as they always had. The concerts, appearances, and music from Queen's final years pushed boundaries and contributed to their legacy just as much as their earlier work.

According to one aid worker, a larger impact than the money raised for the Ethiopian famine is that \"humanitarian concern is now at the centre of foreign policy\" for the west.",
