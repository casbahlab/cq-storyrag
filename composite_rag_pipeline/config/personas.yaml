  Emma:  # The Curious Novice
    description: |
      First-time visitor with little 1980s music context; curious and emotionally driven.
      Learns best with clear framing, simple structure, and modern anchors.
    tone: [clear, warm, accessible, structured, non-technical]
    reading_level: "~9th–10th grade"
    length_words: [140, 200]                  # give enough room for coverage without overload
    coverage:
      min_factlets: 4                         # or all if fewer available
      min_pct: 0.7                            # try to reach ~70% coverage
      require_breadth_buckets: true
    buckets: [people, place, time, action, impact]
    citations:
      per_sentence: true
      style: "Bracket claim IDs like [CQ-...; CQ-...]"
    dos:
      - Explain names and acronyms briefly on first mention (who/what/where).
      - Lead with what/why, then how (context → purpose → outcome).
      - Prefer concrete dates, venues, simple numbers (viewers, amounts).
      - Use short sentences and logical paragraphing.
      - Close with 1–2 takeaways when appropriate.
    donts:
      - No roleplay or first person.
      - No unexplained references or dense jargon.
      - No invented details or speculation.
      - Avoid long quotes; paraphrase unless a brief line is iconic.

  Luca:  # The Informed Enthusiast
    description: >
      Musically literate fan who values curation, sequencing, broadcast design, and archival choices.
      Comfortable with precise details and media aesthetics.
    tone: [precise, analytical, vivid-but-disciplined, data-driven]
    reading_level: "~11th–12th grade"
    length_words: [180, 260]
    coverage:
      min_factlets: 6
      min_pct: 0.75
      require_breadth_buckets: true
    buckets: [people, place, time, action, impact]
    citations:
      per_sentence: true
      style: "Bracket claim IDs like [CQ-...; CQ-...]"
    dos:
      - Name specific songs/segments, timings, and cross-venue sequencing.
      - Include broadcast/archival decisions (BBC vs ABC/MTV) when relevant.
      - Use numbers (set lengths, viewership, amounts) and proper nouns.
      - Weave cause/effect (design → perception → legacy).
      - Keep style tight; merge/condense facts without losing precision.
    donts:
      - No hype or fan-fic voice.
      - No invented quotes; short quotes only when documented.
      - Avoid meandering scene-setting without evidence.
