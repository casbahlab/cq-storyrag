Luca enters the Live Aid exhibit with prior knowledge of the event. A factual summary outlines that Live Aid was a dual-venue benefit concert held on 13 July 1985, organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. The concerts were hosted at Wembley Stadium in London and JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, running for approximately 16 hours and featuring over 60 musical acts. According to event records, it was broadcast to an estimated 1.5 billion viewers across more than 150 countries.
As he progresses through the exhibit, Luca focuses on the technical infrastructure behind the event. Informational displays explain that the concert was broadcast live via satellite uplinks, enabling synchronized performances across two continents. Performance slots were scheduled to alternate between the London and Philadelphia stages, with programming coordinated to align with prime-time slots in key global time zones.
The exhibit includes a section presenting performance data and artist scheduling. Luca reviews documentation on Queen’s 21-minute set at Wembley, which included songs such as “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “Radio Ga Ga,” and “We Are the Champions.” Official setlists confirm the lineup and order of performance. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) recorded and archived the full Wembley concert, while the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) did not retain the Philadelphia master tapes. Reports indicate this decision was made shortly after the event, with consent from the organizers.
Another section displays outcomes linked to the event. Live Aid raised over $125 million (USD) for famine relief. The exhibit notes that it inspired later benefit concerts such as Live 8, and that the Band Aid single “Do They Know It’s Christmas?”, released in 1984, had preceded the concert and became one of the UK’s best-selling charity singles. Additionally, chart data from the Official UK Charts Company shows that several artists experienced a resurgence in sales after the event, including a return of Queen’s Greatest Hits to the charts.
In the final segment, Luca examines how event footage was curated and preserved. Some performances were not included in official video releases due to various reasons, including performance quality, technical issues, or artist preference. Archive metadata differentiates between preserved material (e.g., Wembley full recordings by the BBC) and content not retained or released (e.g., Led Zeppelin’s reunion set).
He is shown the collection of artifacts that are connected to the Live Aid that are present in the BME and where they can be found.
Luca leaves the exhibit with a structured understanding of Live Aid’s logistical scope, archival coverage, broadcast coordination, and philanthropic outcomes.
