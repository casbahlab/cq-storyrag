Emma is young and curious, though not deeply familiar with music history. She’s heard the name “Live Aid” in passing, maybe in a documentary clip or a tweet, but it’s a vague impression, not a reference point. During onboarding, the system identifies her as having low prior familiarity and high openness to discovery, and presents a structured narrative suited for exploration.
The story begins with a concise overview: Live Aid was a global benefit concert held on 13 July 1985, organized to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. Emma learns that the event occurred simultaneously at Wembley Stadium in London and JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, and was linked via satellite broadcast.
As the timeline unfolds, she observes that over 60 artists performed across 16 continuous hours, reaching approximately 1.5 billion viewers in over 150 countries. The information is visualized to clarify scale and sequence.
Her attention shifts to the lineup. She recognizes some artists — Queen, U2, David Bowie, Elton John, Madonna, Paul McCartney — and is introduced to the broader structure of performances across both venues. The system outlines how the performances were sequenced and transmitted between locations.
Next, Emma explores the context: the Ethiopian famine of the early 1980s. She learns how it led to the creation of Band Aid in 1984, followed by Live Aid in 1985, driven by organizers Bob Geldof and Midge Ure. Artists contributed by performing, donating royalties, and using the global stage to raise awareness.
As she nears the end of the experience, Emma examines the legacy of Live Aid. She learns it raised over $125 million and has been recognized as a milestone in music-based humanitarian efforts. Documentation presents Queen’s set at Wembley as a widely referenced highlight. Archival records show that the BBC preserved Wembley’s broadcast, while ABC deleted the Philadelphia master tapes shortly after the event.
The final displays help Emma understand that Live Aid’s legacy includes not just the performances, but also the decisions about what was archived and made accessible. The system links these insights to specific media artifacts, including press releases, artist schedules, and archive logs, reinforcing factual connections.
She is shown the collection of artifacts that are connected to the Live Aid that are present in the BME and where they can be found.
Emma leaves the experience with a clear and structured understanding of Live Aid, its origins, logistics, performances, and legacy, presented in a way that supports incremental learning and exploration.
