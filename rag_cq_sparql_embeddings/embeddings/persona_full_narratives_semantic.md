# Persona Narrative: Emma

Welcome to our exhibit on Live Aid, one of the most iconic charity events in history! I'm Emma, your friendly museum storyteller, and I'll guide you through this extraordinary story.

## Entry
Imagine it's July 1985. The world is facing a devastating famine in Ethiopia, and a global response is needed to help those affected. In London, a legendary concert is being planned – Live Aid – a dual-venue benefit concert held simultaneously at Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. Over the course of two days, some of the biggest names in music come together to raise awareness and funds for the Ethiopian people.

The event is broadcasted live on eight major television networks across the world, including ABC, BBC, and MTV. Some of the incredible performers scheduled to take the stage include Queen, The Who, U2, Dire Straits, Bryan Adams, and many more.

## Core
As you walk through our exhibit, you'll see firsthand the electrifying performances that took place on those historic days in 1985. One of the most memorable moments was when Queen's lead vocalist Freddie Mercury took the stage at Wembley Stadium. With his signature charisma and incredible vocal range, he delivered a show-stopping performance of "Radio Ga Ga," "We Will Rock You," and "Bohemian Rhapsody." The crowd went wild as he played with every ounce of energy he had!

U2's Bono also stole the show with their heart-wrenching rendition of "Where the Streets Have No Name." Meanwhile, Dire Straits' Bob Geldof (who was one of the driving forces behind Live Aid) brought an unforgettable performance to the stage with their iconic hit song "Money for Nothing."

## Exit
The impact of Live Aid was nothing short of extraordinary. In just a few hours, the concert raised over $125 million in aid for Ethiopia and drew attention from millions worldwide. The event's success marked a pivotal moment in music history, showcasing the power of collective action and compassion.

Live Aid's legacy extends far beyond its fundraising goals. It paved the way for future charity concerts like Live 8 and one-off performances that bring people together to make a difference. As you leave our exhibit, remember the words of Queen's Freddie Mercury: "We are all in this together."

# Persona Narrative: Luca

What an incredible event we're about to recount. On July 13, 1985, two legendary concerts came together to make history: Live Aid. The brainchild of Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, this dual-venue extravaganza aimed to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia.

## Entry
As we step into the story, let's set the scene. Two massive stadiums, JFK Stadium in Philadelphia and Wembley Stadium in London, were abuzz with anticipation. Over 89,000 people packed JFK, while a staggering 72,000 gathered at Wembley – an estimated audience of 1.5 billion worldwide was tuning in via satellite link. The air was electric as some of the biggest names in music took to the stage.

## Core
The performances were nothing short of phenomenal. In London, U2 kicked off the proceedings with a powerful rendition of "Sunday Bloody Sunday." Sting followed suit with a mesmerizing performance of "Roxanne," while Phil Collins brought the house down with an intense take on "In the Air Tonight." Eric Clapton's iconic "Layla" got everyone swaying to the blues. But it was David Bowie who stole the show with his poignant performance of "Heroes," setting the tone for what would become a day of musical unity and humanitarian purpose.

## Exit
As we exit this extraordinary event, let's reflect on its lasting impact. Live Aid raised over $125 million for famine relief efforts, but its influence extended far beyond that. It inspired future benefit concerts like Live 8 in 2005, cementing the power of music to bring people together in times of need. The artifacts from these legendary performances – David Bowie's stage outfit, Elton John's performance jacket, and a guitar from Queen's set – are now preserved at the British Music Experience (BME) in London, serving as a poignant reminder of this pivotal moment in music history. Live Aid was more than just a concert; it was a testament to the enduring spirit of hope, unity, and creative expression that continues to inspire us today.
