    "FullNarrative": "Here is a 3-part narrative based on the provided context.\n\n## Entry\nOn July 13, 1985, a historic event took place at Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. The dual-venue benefit concert, known as Live Aid, aimed to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. A multitude of iconic artists from around the world came together to perform in front of a massive global audience. Among them were Queen, U2, Madonna, David Bowie, Eric Clapton, and many more.\n\n## Core\nThe event's organizers, Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, had been inspired by the BBC's coverage of the Ethiopian famine. They quickly rallied other artists to join in and help raise awareness and funds for the cause. The Live Aid concert became a monumental effort, with an estimated 1.5 billion people watching worldwide. The event was broadcast live on television, with simultaneous performances at both Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia.\n\n## Exit\nThe impact of Live Aid extended far beyond its immediate goal of raising funds for Ethiopian famine relief. It played a significant role in popularizing the use of celebrity-driven charity events and has been credited as an inspiration for future benefit concerts. The event's success can be measured by the estimated $150 million raised, making it one of the most successful charity efforts in history. However, despite its significance, some details of Live Aid remain unclear, such as which organization preserved the Wembley broadcast, while another organization failed to preserve the Philadelphia broadcast."

    "FullNarrative": "## Entry\nThe Live Aid concert was a dual-venue benefit concert held on July 13, 1985, in London and Philadelphia. It was one of the largest-scale live events in history, with an estimated global TV audience of approximately 1.5 billion people. The concert featured a wide range of iconic musicians, including Queen, U2, David Bowie, and Madonna.\n\nThe event took place at Wembley Stadium in London, which held around 72,000 attendees, and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, which accommodated approximately 89,484 attendees. The performances were divided between the two venues, with some artists performing on both stages simultaneously.\n\nIn London, U2 performed songs such as \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"Bad,\" while Queen delivered an iconic set featuring hits like \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"Radio Ga Ga.\" In Philadelphia, David Bowie took the stage to perform his song \"Tears in Heaven,\" among others. Other notable performances included those by Madonna, Dire Straits, and Led Zeppelin.\n\n## Core\nThe Live Aid concert was a defining moment in music history, showcasing the power of collaboration and solidarity in the face of global crisis. The event's impact can be seen in its performances, setlists, and broadcast legacy.\n\nQueen's performance at Wembley Stadium is often cited as one of the greatest live sets ever. Their iconic rendition of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was a highlight of the concert, featuring Freddie Mercury's incredible vocal range and stage presence. The song's operatic sections were perfectly complemented by the crowd's enthusiastic singing along.\n\nU2's performance at Wembley Stadium was also notable for its energy and passion. Their setlist featured several classic hits, including \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" and \"With or Without You.\" The band's ability to connect with the audience through their music was on full display during their performance.\n\nThe concert was broadcast live on television in over 150 countries, with an estimated global audience of 1.5 billion people. The event's impact was felt far beyond the two venues, inspiring a new era of charity concerts and raising awareness for humanitarian causes around the world.\n\n## Exit\nLive Aid's cultural impact extends far beyond its performances. The event has been credited with inspiring later benefit concerts such as Live 8 in 2005. These events have continued to raise awareness and funds for various causes, from poverty and hunger to disease research and disaster relief.\n\nThe artifacts from Live Aid performances are preserved at the British Music Experience (BME), a museum showcasing the history of popular music in the UK. The BME features exhibits on iconic musicians and bands that performed during Live Aid, including Queen and U2. These artifacts serve as a reminder of the concert's significance and its enduring impact on music history.\n\nThe legacy of Live Aid continues to inspire new generations of musicians and artists, serving as a testament to the power of music to bring people together in times of crisis and need. Its influence can be seen in countless charity concerts and events that have followed in its footsteps, cementing its place as one of the most iconic moments in rock history."
