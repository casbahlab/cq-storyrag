# Persona Narrative: Emma

Here is a 3-part narrative based on the provided context.

## Entry
On July 13, 1985, a historic event took place at Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. The dual-venue benefit concert, known as Live Aid, aimed to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. A multitude of iconic artists from around the world came together to perform in front of a massive global audience. Among them were Queen, U2, Madonna, David Bowie, Eric Clapton, and many more.

## Core
The event's organizers, Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, had been inspired by the BBC's coverage of the Ethiopian famine. They quickly rallied other artists to join in and help raise awareness and funds for the cause. The Live Aid concert became a monumental effort, with an estimated 1.5 billion people watching worldwide. The event was broadcast live on television, with simultaneous performances at both Wembley Stadium in London and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia.

## Exit
The impact of Live Aid extended far beyond its immediate goal of raising funds for Ethiopian famine relief. It played a significant role in popularizing the use of celebrity-driven charity events and has been credited as an inspiration for future benefit concerts. The event's success can be measured by the estimated $150 million raised, making it one of the most successful charity efforts in history. However, despite its significance, some details of Live Aid remain unclear, such as which organization preserved the Wembley broadcast, while another organization failed to preserve the Philadelphia broadcast.
